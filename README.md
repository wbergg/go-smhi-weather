## SMHI API weather collector

Tool I used to collect and present weather from SMHI's API with wttr.in as inspiration.

No idea if this is of any use to anyone, SMHI is the Swedish Metrological Weather Institute. I guess it's just for me trying to learn GO and how to fetch and presenting data from an API.
